# NB Media Videos

This directory should contain the following video files:
- nbmedia_video1.mp4
- nbmedia_video2.mp4
- nbmedia_video3.mp4

To make the videos work properly:
1. Download the videos from Google Drive
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this directory (public/videos/)

If you encounter any issues, the app will automatically use fallback videos.
